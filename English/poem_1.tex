\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
This sadness does not die with her

Like a cup of tea\\
overflowing\\
she keeps going places\\
unexpected\\
beyond will and power

drawing in the tablecloth\\
a silhouette\\
of sweet fragrance\\
in the white morning

I want to follow\\
and drape my heart\\
in her warm remembrance\\
like a make-believe ghost\\
and make her laugh

Come Sadness!

Let us play a game:\\
stop this deluge\\
see my trembling face\\
in every cup
\end{verse}
