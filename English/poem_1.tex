\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
This sadness does not die with her

Like a cup of tea\\
overflowing\\
she keeps going places\\
unexpected\\
beyond will and power

dyeing the tablecloth\\
with a silhouette\\
of sweet fragrance\\
in the white morning

I want to reach\\
and drape my heart\\
in the warm remembrance\\
like a make-believe ghost\\
and make her laugh

But I can't move\\
in the still second\\
waiting for the ebb\\
to take me away\\
to take her away

Come Sadness!

Let us play a game:\\
stop this deluge\\
and find my trembling face\\
in every cup of tea
\end{verse}
