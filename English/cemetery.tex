\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  When the sky, like a sea overturned, \\
  shines brigthly with your eyes, \\
  I raise and plunge into the deep, \\
  in the search of blue pearls.

  In the vertigo of the coming billow, \\
  the diver weighted of a stone \\
  desperately sinks a breaststroke \\
  like a rhythmical prayer

  until, in the cemetery of stars, \\
  two white shellfish become iridescent, \\
  moons under a shroud of sails;

  unveiling its ultramarine irises, \\
  the Abyss recognises the sailor \\
  and promises him other shores.
\end{verse}
