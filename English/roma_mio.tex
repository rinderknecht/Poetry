\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Crossing your gaze and \emph{Roma} falls upside down; \\
  day-sleeping and watching the night rising \\
  in your hair; feeling your body thrill \\
  --- at my hands caressing you, perhaps.

  A glimpse of you and \emph{Roma} dazzles in the mirror; \\
  a unique moon and thousands of your shadows \\
  leading me through the tiled streets, \\
  grazing my lips that you astonish.

  Kissing you and I taste \emph{Roma} head down; \\
  walking on the palate of your mouth \\
  between the aromas of caper and garlic; \\
  licking your fingers until you lose it.

  Singing you and \emph{Roma} sounds from above; \\
  amongst the statues, I hear your laughter \\
  teasing the Colosseum's ragged clothes, \\
  solemnity that your lightness overthrows.

  Writing you and you read \emph{Roma} in reverse; \\
  never telling it to you and away with bad luck, \\
  always making it to you and the miracle again: \\
  \emph{Roma mio}, till death do us part?
\end{verse}
