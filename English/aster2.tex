\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Hope is the aster \\
in the eastern plain \\
of weeds and flower \\
from last night's rain

Blue is the flower \\
under sky unborn \\
like secret Easter \\
too light to be borne

Northern breeze whispers \\
to the shapphire \\
worships of Vespers \\
and hearths with fire

Summer rain is mercy \\
said Shakespeare \\
but so is merci \\
from one heart's dear

Oh picking you up \\
to my beating heart! \\
Drinking from Christ's cup \\
setting you apart

no more rolling dice \\
your petals like lips \\
will touch Paradise \\
where love never sleeps
\end{verse}
