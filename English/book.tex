\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  You used to hide in my books \\
  like in crannies and nooks

  I would find you in Neruda \\
  even Val√©ry \\
  sieving my favourite pages \\
  for a bit of my soul

  But metaphors whispered \\
  about love \\
  in ways I could not \\
  in ways I dared not

  until I found a curl of hair \\
  you left in a margin

  A prod to the brass spring \\
  suddendly \\
  has my heart palpitating \\
  like a broken watch

  Bent over those pages \\
  in the corner of a table \\
  the words fade to white \\
  like a film overexposed \\
  to the halo of your blond hair

  only leaving behind \\
  the offbeat heart \\
  of a blind man
\end{verse}
