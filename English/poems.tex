\settowidth{\versewidth}{Like a make-believe ghost}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Like a cup of tea \\
  overflowing

  she keeps going places \\
  unexpected \\
  beyond will and power

  drawing silhouettes \\
  of sweet fragrance \\
  on this white morning

  and I can't help but clutch \\
  at the burning tablecloth

  again and again

  I drape this tainted love \\
  over my broken heart \\
  and I keep going places \\
  unexpected

  like a make-believe ghost \\
  haunting cups of tea \\
  with trembling faces

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Without a thought \\
  you hand me a second jar

  Without a thought \\
  I open it and you smile \\
  in profile \\
  at this intimacy \\
  like a wife

  Hidden in plain sight \\
  I wish we were them

  secret delights \\
  that can touch \\
  and be open \\
  without a thought

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Late among the guests \\
  shining and laughing \\
  at brilliant jokes

  we share one last drink \\
  with two ice cubes

  Side by side \\
  complicit and beautiful

  reflecting the moonlight

  fatal icebergs \\
  always \\
  float in a world of silence

  always \\
  shortchange the stars \\
  ninety percent

  below the surface

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Her dangling arms \\
  abandoned to the wind \\
  like lianas

  gently beat to the rhythm \\
  of her footsteps

  oblivious to the choir \\
  of the forest around us \\
  whispering

  staring \\
  at the divine pendulums

  waiting for a sign

  as I do

  know the wild deer \\
  invisible yet so close

  Hear its deep chest \\
  darkly drumming \\
  an untamed song

  about you
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  What a waste \\
  I tell myself

  this whole bread \\
  stale \\
  which you forgot \\
  at the back of the cupboard

  I remember the loaf \\
  warm and tender \\
  like a promise \\
  of young love

  and

  you say

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Cheerfully \\
  you guide me through \\
  your physics book

  on magnetism \\
  between opposites

  on forward \\
  and reverse phases

  on tension \\
  and discharge

  Finally \\
  I listen to you \\
  only with gravity

  weak

  within arm's reach

  When you go through my lines \\

  and you want to slip too

  with me

  a blank page

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Away

  birch trees \\
  bathed \\
  in warm sunlight

  Close

  your white fingers \\
  combing \\
  your golden hair

  Blinded

  you guide my hands \\
  to the clear waters \\
  of the fountain

  Thirsty

  from your lips \\
  the gulp \\
  eclipses the sun

\settowidth{\versewidth}{to the halo of your blond hair}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  You used to hide in my books \\
  like in crannies and nooks

  I would find you in Neruda \\
  sieving my favorite pages \\
  for a nugget of my soul

  but metaphors whispered \\
  in ways I could not \\
  in ways I dared not

  until I found a curl of hair \\
  you left in a margin

  Suddenly

  a prod to the brass spring \\
  sends my heart palpitating \\
  like a broken watch

  Bent over those pages \\
  on the corner of a table \\
  the words fade to white \\
  like a film overexposed \\
  to the halo of your blond hair

  only leaving behind \\
  the offbeat heart \\
  of a blind man
\end{verse}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{on your body of soft amber}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Tonight \\
  you open for me \\
  an alchemy book

  By the oil lamp \\
  flickering \\
  the mute book speaks \\
  in crucibles and symbols

  of wild roses blooming \\
  on a lover's grave

  of a split pomegranate \\
  under two half moons

  of bellows sighing \\
  over furnace anew

  of the mystical kiss \\
  of water and fire

  of the geography \\
  of beauty spots

  a secret zodiac for all senses \\
  on your body of soft amber \\
  where I die and am reborn
\end{verse}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{would ascend into the starry night}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Do you remember \\
  how we used to play \\
  winter in summer?

  I'd furrow your hair \\
  with the tip of my tongue \\
  and the field would shiver \\
  under the plow

  I'd sit behind you \\
  and embrace you like a coat \\
  my breath sending a frisson \\
  down your spine

  I'd pretend to sled \\
  my hands on your waist \\
  and your nervous laughter \\
  would melt my heart

  As exhausted as the day \\
  you'd fall back on me \\
  and our breaths like geysers \\
  would ascend into the starry night

  slowly spinning \\
  around our cold noses \\
  against each other \\
  in the equator of my arms \\
  around you
\end{verse}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{a boundless kaleidoscope}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Once \\
  through a window \\
  of the log cabin \\
  at dawn

  we caught \\
  the shivering world \\
  transfixed \\
  watching its reflection \\
  in the dew

  In a blink \\
  the round mirrors \\
  of iridescent water \\
  had formed \\
  a boundless kaleidoscope \\
  and showed each other

  your dreamy eyes \\
  in vision wide

  and wondered
\end{verse}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{Yet you arise in the still second}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Already the avid hour \\
  swallows \\
  the shores of the world

  Towards the horizon \\
  shadows pursue whispers \\
  lost among the graves \\
  along the walls

  From his skull \\
  the poet sees everywhere \\
  ink flooding in

  Yet you arise \\
  in the still second \\
  of the vault \\
  illuminating the doorway

  with your bright face \\
  smiling down on me \\
  simple and elegant \\
  like a blade

  In a sarabande \\
  you seem to say \\
  come outside \\
  in the fields of blue

  and let your heart \\
  slowly beat the drum \\
  of another day

  let this long night \\
  surprise you \\
  with a blue moon
\end{verse}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{my lips still reach for the heavens}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  The dying day shrinks \\
  between the clouds \\
  and the rain starts drawing \\
  mirrors in the mud

  until darkness drowns \\
  the match of eloquence \\
  and needles start piercing \\
  the firmament \\
  into countless suns

  They blink leagues away \\
  like you used to

  when you stretched over me \\
  like a constellation \\
  and kissed me distantly

  Now on my knees \\
  my lips still reach for the stars \\
  but the gulp is dirty water
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{like those of a silent film actor}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Quietly set against the light \\
  you are perfectly framed

  I don't care what they think \\
  about the optics of love \\
  about the perfect shot \\
  at wild happiness

  Like a forest \\
  leaning against the twilight

  you harbor within yourself \\
  multitudes \\
  that murmur darkly like one \\
  and suddenly go silent \\
  whenever someone laughs

  Slowly I dare a hand \\
  to your black hair \\
  shadow amongst shadows

  but you are startled by my eyes \\
  like those of a silent film actor \\
  in a close-up

  Caught in my headlights \\
  this magnificent soul of yours \\
  hesitates before flitting away

  leaving me in awe

  pupils dilated \\
  quietly peering into your night
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  \emph{In my brimming eyes}

  \ \ the hinterland \\
  \ \ suddenly \\
  \ \ met a rising tide

  \emph{a painting by Turner}

  \ \ of ripped curtains of mist \\
  \ \ behind an old boat \\
  \ \ tugged to her last berth \\
  \ \ to be broken up

  \emph{where flowing waters wash}

  \ \ beams and lashes across

  \emph{your overcast eyelines}

  \ \ wrecked by promises \\
  \ \ lying eerily at the bottom \\
  \ \ of your Black Sea

  \emph{magnificent and haunting}

  \ \ you follow again the wind \\
  \ \ moaning in faraway sails

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  \emph{I raise my standard like a sail}

  \ \ catching oblique sunbeams \\
  \ \ from the fleeing horizon \\
  \ \ on the seas \\
  \ \ above the firmament

  \emph{and I set the course}

  \ \ for your heart \\
  \ \ overturned \\
  \ \ like an inkwell on a letter

  \emph{to you}

  \ \ for I smuggle jewels \\
  \ \ from the celestial orbs

  \emph{under the cover of night}

  \ \ I will show you \\
  \ \ my treasure \\
  \ \ quaint and eccentric

  \emph{like a comet}

  \ \ always feeling the pull \\
  \ \ to your circular orbit

  \emph{from an archipelago of solitude}

  \ \ because the island \\
  \ \ comes to the shipwrecked

\settowidth{\versewidth}{Under shroud and vermin}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Under a coat of ermine \\
  dreams offer the skies \\
  echos scattered away

  on the white page

  the inkwell overturns \\
  like the horizon

  Under shroud and vermin \\
  the yearning soul cries \\
  echos scattered away

  on the snow field

  darkness many returns \\
  flood the horizon
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{where you search for me}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Those clear eyes

  clearer yet this morning \\
  to have loved another

  A clearer sky

  whose rising Sun \\
  left two blue puddles \\
  where you search for me \\
  amid the dew

\settowidth{\versewidth}{to the necklaces of their laughter}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Sleds rush down a hill~--- \\
  each bump threading a note \\
  to the braids of their life lines \\
  to the necklaces of their laughter

  Like them \\
  I draw on immaculate pages \\
  invisible parallels \\
  that conjure up your silhouette

  Hide and seek in the mist~--- \\
  your white hands over my eyes \\
  your panting for breath \\
  sends a long shiver down \\
  blending with that of winter

  I caress the blank pages \\
  of a book open to the invisible \\
  invoking your pale body \\
  under my fingers

  trembling on soft hills

  my breath is taken away \\
  at each descent \\
  so impatient at each ascent!

  Exhausted~--- \\
  lying on the snow \\
  we watch passing clouds \\
  and I quench my thirst \\
  in the calm stream \\
  of your words \\
  before oblivion

  Only remain these verses \\
  in Braille \\
  where I feel your steps \\
  towards the white paradise
\end{verse}

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{and who would love us then}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  In your secret garden \\
  when the early light \\
  accounts for the world \\
  you prune the rosebushes

  like the many queer lives \\
  within you that ask \\
  something always refused

  You keep saying to them

  \emph{If I listened to you \\
  we would grow wild \\
  and who would love us then \\
  You can only feel and I see \\
  Go to your places and sleep}

  But sometimes \\
  a whisper quivers \\
  and blooms under the sun

  transfiguring you \\
  and making you divine \\
  in spite of yourself

  before flitting away \\
  like a dream cut short

  Will you ever be \\
  like that always \\
  for any one being?
\end{verse}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\settowidth{\versewidth}{like that afternoon}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  In this waltz \\
  of oblivion and regrets

  I step forwards \\
  and I forget \\
  all the lessons \\
  I swore to remember

  You step backwards \\
  and you regret \\
  learning so much \\
  about me

  Come

  The third beat \\
  is not here yet \\
  We don't have to repeat \\
  the same missteps

  against each other

  let us stand still \\
  like that afternoon \\
  in the pouring rain \\
  when I warmed you \\
  in my arms

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Across the dinner table \\
  a basin of apples \\
  where you used to sit

  classically framed and lit \\
  with the soft tones \\
  of your cheeks

  full and ripe \\
  from your wide smile

  where I used to sink \\
  my teeth for a taste \\
  of good and naughty

  Is this still life \\
  still a life?

  Again \\

  and the world \\
  again \\
  is an old-fashioned waltz

  slowing with a smile

  like a ballerina \\
  on a music box \\
  she did her best

  like the rest of us \\
  spinning \\
  on this Earth

  raising our arms \\
  to the sky

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  By the Seaside \\
  when everyone's going home

  tired

  an orange Sun is planed down \\

  on the waters

  of salty pupils

  by a Monet in a museum \\
  when everyone's going home
\end{verse}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{needles in your heart}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Stitched little doll \\
  you felt forgotten

  needles in your heart \\
  when pressed \\
  against her bosom

  so \\
  \ \ \ \ \ softly

  you wished away \\
  the wise tailor \\
  mending your seams

  Like you \\
  she was cursed

  but so close \\
  that her heartbeat \\
  was already yours

\settowidth{\versewidth}{The wake of two passing boats}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  The wake of two passing boats \\
  joggled the lonely pier \\
  in the late evening

  and it was love in a blink \\
  by the riverside

  Rocked like buoys

  bulging tears \\
  mirrored those tipsy ships \\
  larger than life

  until night fell \\
  and your head leaned softly \\
  like a wilting rose

  Eyes closed \\
  you took his hand
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{So I followed your footsteps}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Eyes closed \\
  arms stretched \\
  you'd seek my neck

  up

  you'd bring your toes \\
  to the feast

  laughing at the tasting

  So I followed your footsteps \\
  to your neck \\
  which grew strong

  up

  from acorn to oak \\
  sheltering my tired hands

  and now you pick me up \\
  so high \\
  I can't reach my feet

  little brother

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  I like the way you feel \\
  about things

  You pull sour grapes \\
  on a blanket at your feet \\
  and the night ripens \\
  with aromas known \\
  only to you

  Like a blind woman \\
  telling fortunes \\
  you grope faces \\
  in your night \\
  full of constellations

  so they might see \\
  they are not alone

  I like the way you fill \\
  the blanks of my life

  like the summer storm knocks \\
  on my windows \\
  and puts my sorrows to sleep \\
  after a silent day

  Most of all \\
  I like the way you feel \\
  about me

\settowidth{\versewidth}{in a corner of my heart}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  As evening falls

  leaves start swirling \\
  in a corner of my heart \\

  Like sparks \\
  twist and turn away \\
  from the crackling logs

  midsummer Eve \\
  kindles promises \\
  of Adam's fall

  away \\
  from the camp fire \\
  into our night

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Playful like the echo \\
  you come back to me

  and tickle my ears \\
  with your tongue \\
  in a curl

  and breathe out shivers \\
  up and down my spine

  Losing myself in your arms \\
  you are me and I am you

  in a sigh

  I hear a distant memory \\
  but I don't recall \\
  what words are

  As God didn't create \\

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  The genuine heart of sadness \\

  Without it \\

  Yet it remains still \\
  and hopeless

  Without it \\

  I could never read you \\

  by your teardrops

  and your longhand \\
  still casts eyeshadows \\
  under my fingers

  Now that my eyesight is restored \\

  Breathtaking art is heart \\

  A lonely sleeper at night \\
  waits on railway tracks \\
  to be taken away

  like a casket steadied \\

  Hope is the aster \\

  Northern breeze whispers \\
  to the sapphire \\
  worships of vespers \\

  but wind's promises \\
  blow the candlelight \\

  Oh picking you up \\

  Oh drink from my cup \\

  No more rolling dice: \\
