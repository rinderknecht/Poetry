\settowidth{\versewidth}{Like a make-believe ghost}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Like a cup of tea \\
  overflowing

  she keeps going places \\
  unexpected \\
  beyond will and power

  drawing silhouettes \\
  of sweet fragrance \\
  on the white morning

  and I can't help but clutch \\
  at the burning tablecloth

  again and again

  I drape my tainted heart \\
  like a make-believe ghost \\
  and keep going places \\
  unexpected

  haunting every cup of tea \\
  with a trembling face
\end{verse}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{You hand me a second jar}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Without a thought \\
  you hand me a second jar

  Without a thought \\
  I open it and you smile \\
  in profile \\
  at this intimacy \\
  like a wife

  I wish we were them

  hidden in plain sight

  secret delights \\
  that can touch \\
  and be open \\
  without a thought
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{float on a world of silence}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Late among the guests \\
  beaming and laughing \\
  at brilliant jokes

  we share one last drink \\
  with two ice cubes

  Side by side \\
  complicit and beautiful

  reflecting the moonlight

  fatal icebergs \\
  always \\
  float in a world of silence

  always \\
  shortchange the stars \\
  ninety percent

  below the surface
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{to the rhythm of her steps}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Her dangling arms \\
  abandoned to the wind \\
  like lianas

  gently beat \\
  to the rhythm of her steps

  oblivious to the choir \\
  of the forest around us \\
  whispering

  staring \\
  at the divine pendulums

  waiting for a sign

  as I do

  know the wild deer \\
  invisible yet so close

  Hear its deep chest \\
  darkly drumming \\
  an untamed song

  about you
\end{verse}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{--- Let's make French toasts!}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  What a waste \\
  I tell myself

  this whole bread \\
  stale \\
  which you forgot \\
  at the back of the cupboard

  I remember the loaf \\
  warm and tender \\
  like a promise \\
  of young love

  and

  --- Let's make French toasts! \\
  you say
\end{verse}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{When you go through my lines}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  When you go through my lines \\
  with me

  sometimes \\
  I slip in my own words \\
  and you want to slip too

  with me

  a blank page
\end{verse}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{to the clear waters}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Away

  birch trees \\
  bathed \\
  in warm sunlight

  Close

  your white fingers \\
  combing \\
  your golden hair

  Blinded

  you guide my hands \\
  to the clear waters \\
  of the fountain

  Thirsty

  from your lips \\
  the gulp \\
  eclipses the sun
\end{verse}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{to the halo of your blond hair}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  You used to hide in my books \\
  like in crannies and nooks

  I would find you in Neruda \\
  sieving my favourite pages \\
  for a nugget of my soul

  But metaphors whispered \\
  in ways I could not \\
  in ways I dared not

  until I found a curl of hair \\
  you left in a margin

  Suddenly

  a prod to the brass spring \\
  sends my heart palpitating \\
  like a broken watch

  Bent over those pages \\
  on the corner of a table \\
  the words fade to white \\
  like a film overexposed \\
  to the halo of your blond hair

  only leaving behind \\
  the offbeat heart \\
  of a blind man
\end{verse}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{on your body of soft amber}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Tonight \\
  you open for me \\
  an alchemy book

  By the oil lamp \\
  flickering \\
  the mute book speaks \\
  in crucibles and symbols

  of wild roses blooming \\
  on a lover's grave

  of a split pomegranate \\
  under two half moons

  of bellows sighing \\
  over furnace anew

  of the mystical kiss \\
  of water and fire

  of the geography \\
  of beauty spots

  a secret zodiac for all senses \\
  on your body of soft amber \\
  where I die and am reborn
\end{verse}

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{and our breaths like geysers}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Do you remember \\
  how we used to play \\
  winter in summer?

  You would furrow my hair \\
  with the tip of your tongue \\
  and the field would shiver \\
  under the plough

  I would sit behind you \\
  and embrace you like a coat \\
  my breath sending a frisson \\
  down your spine

  I would pretend to sled \\
  my hands on your waist \\
  and your nervous laughter \\
  would melt my heart

  As exhausted as the day \\
  you fall back on me \\
  and our breaths like geysers \\
  ascend to the starry night

  slowly spinning \\
  around our cold noses \\
  against each other \\
  in the equator of my arms \\
  around you
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{the infinite kaleidoscope}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Once \\
  through a window \\
  of the log cabin \\
  at dawn

  we caught \\
  the shivering world \\
  transfixed \\
  watching its reflection \\
  in the dew

  In a blink \\
  the round mirrors \\
  of iridescent water \\
  had formed \\
  a boundless kaleidoscope \\
  and showed each other

  your dreamy eyes \\
  and vision wide

  and wondered
\end{verse}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{Yet you arise in the still second}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Already the avid hour \\
  swallows \\
  the shores of the world

  Towards the horizon \\
  shadows pursue whispers \\
  lost amongst the graves \\
  along the walls

  From his skull \\
  the poet sees everywhere \\
  ink flooding him

  Yet you arise \\
  in the still second \\
  illuminating the doorway \\
  of the vault

  your bright face \\
  smiling down on me \\
  simple and elegant \\
  like a blade

  In a sarabande \\
  you seem to say \\
  come outside \\
  in the fields of blue

  and let your heart \\
  slowly beat the drum \\
  of another day

  let this long night \\
  surprise you \\
  with a blue moon
\end{verse}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{my lips still reach for the heavens}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  The dying day shrinks \\
  between the clouds \\
  and the rain starts drawing \\
  mirrors in the mud

  until darkness drowns \\
  the match of eloquence \\
  and needles start piercing \\
  the firmament \\
  in suns uncountable

  They blink leagues away \\
  like you used to

  when you stretched over me \\
  like a constellation \\
  and kissed me distantly

  Now on my knees \\
  my lips still reach for the stars \\
  but the gulp is dirty water
\end{verse}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{like those of a silent film actor}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Quietly set against the light \\
  you are perfectly framed

  I don't care what they think \\
  about the optics of love \\
  about the perfect shot \\
  at wild happiness

  Like a forest \\
  leaning against the twilight

  you harbour within yourself \\
  a multitude of lives \\
  that murmur darkly like one \\
  and suddenly go quiet \\
  whenever someone laughs

  Slowly I dare a hand \\
  to your black hair \\
  shadow amongst shadows

  But you are startled by my eyes \\
  like those of a silent film actor \\
  in a close-up

  Caught in my headlights \\
  this magnificent soul of yours \\
  hesitates before fliting away

  leaving me in awe

  pupils dilated \\
  quietly peering into your night
\end{verse}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{yet better off than broken up}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The hinterland \\
suddenly \\
met a rising tide

in my brimming eyes

a painting by Turner \\
of ripped curtains of mist \\
behind an old boat \\
tugged to her last berth

to be broken up

The flowing waters \\
also washed a raft \\
across

your overcast eyelines

wrecked by promises \\
lying quietly at the bottom \\
of some Black Sea

magnificent and haunting

you heard the wind \\
moaning in search \\
of faraway sails
\end{verse}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{and who would love us then}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  In your secret garden \\
  when the early light \\
  accounts for the world \\
  you prune the rosebushes

  like the many queer lives \\
  within you that ask \\
  something always refused

  You keep saying to them

  \emph{If I listen to you \\
  we would grow wild \\
  and who would love us then \\
  You can only feel and I see \\
  Go to your places and sleep}

  But sometimes \\
  a whisper would quiver \\
  and bloom under a puzzled sun

  transfiguring you \\
  and making you divine \\
  inspite of yourself

  before fliting away \\
  like a dream cut short

  Will you ever be \\
  like that always \\
  for any one being?
\end{verse}
