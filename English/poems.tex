\settowidth{\versewidth}{Like a make-believe ghost}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Like a cup of tea \\
  overflowing

  she keeps going places \\
  unexpected \\
  beyond will and power

  drawing silhouettes \\
  of sweet fragrance \\
  on the white morning

  and I can't help but clutch \\
  at the burning tablecloth

  again and again

  I drape my heart \\
  like a make-believe ghost \\
  and keep going places \\
  unexpected

  haunting every cup of tea \\
  with a trembling face
\end{verse}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{You hand me a second jar}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Without a thought \\
  you hand me a second jar

  Without a thought \\
  I open it and you smile \\
  in profile \\
  at this intimacy \\
  like a wife

  I wish we were them

  hidden in plain sight

  secret delights \\
  that can touch \\
  and be open \\
  without a thought
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{float in a world of silence}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Among the guests \\
  beaming and laughing \\
  at brilliant jokes

  we share a drink \\
  with two ice cubes

  Side by side \\
  complicit and beautiful

  reflecting the sunlight

  fatal icebergs \\
  always \\
  float in a world of silence

  always \\
  shortchange the suns \\
  ninety percent

  below the surface
\end{verse}

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{to the rhythm of her steps}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Her dangling arms \\
  abandoned to the wind \\
  like lianas

  gently beat \\
  to the rhythm of her steps

  oblivious to the choir \\
  of the forest around us \\
  whispering

  staring \\
  at the divine pendulums

  waiting for a sign

  as I do

  know the wild deer \\
  invisible yet so close

  Hear its deep chest \\
  darkly drumming \\
  an untamed song

  about you
\end{verse}

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{--- Let's make French toasts!}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  What a waste \\
  I tell myself

  This whole bread \\
  stale \\
  which you forgot \\
  at the back of the cupboard

  I remember the loaf \\
  warm and tender \\
  like a promise \\
  of young love

  and

  --- Let's make French toasts! \\
  you say
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{When you go through my lines}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  When you go through my lines \\
  with me

  sometimes \\
  I slip in my own words \\
  and you want to slip too

  with me

  a blank page
\end{verse}

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{like that afternoon}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  In this waltz \\
  of oblivion \\
  and regrets

  I step forwards \\
  and I forget \\
  all the lessons \\
  I swore to remember

  You step backwards \\
  and you regret \\
  learning so much \\
  about me

  Come

  The third beat \\
  is not here yet \\

  we don't have to repeat \\
  the same mistakes

  spinning \\
  against each other

  Let us stand still \\
  like that afternoon \\
  in the pouring rain \\
  when I warmed you \\
  in my arms
\end{verse}

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{to the clear waters}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Blinded

  you guide my hands \\
  to the clear waters \\
  of the fountain

  Thirsty

  from your lips \\
  the gulp \\
  eclipses the sun
\end{verse}

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{your white fingers}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Away

  birch trees \\
  bathed \\
  in warm sunlight

  Close

  your white fingers \\
  combing \\
  your golden hair
\end{verse}

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{to the halo of your blond hair}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  You used to hide in my books \\
  like in crannies and nooks

  I would find you in Neruda \\
  sieving my favourite pages \\
  for a bit of my soul

  But metaphors whispered \\
  in ways I could not \\
  in ways I dared not

  until I found a curl of hair \\
  you left in a margin

  A prod to the brass spring \\
  suddenly \\
  has my heart palpitating \\
  like a broken watch

  Bent over those pages \\
  on the corner of a table \\
  the words fade to white \\
  like a film overexposed \\
  to the halo of your blond hair

  only leaving behind \\
  the offbeat heart \\
  of a blind man
\end{verse}

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{on your body of soft amber}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Tonight \\
  you open for me \\
  an alchemy book

  Flickering \\
  by the oil lamp \\
  the mute book speaks \\
  in crucibles and symbols

  of wild roses blooming \\
  on lovers' grave

  of a split pomegranate \\
  under a full moon

  of bellows sighing \\
  over furnace anew

  of the mystical union \\
  of water and fire

  of the celestial geography \\
  of your beauty spots

  a secret zodiac for all senses \\
  on your body of soft amber \\
  where I die and am reborn

\end{verse}

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{would meet night immense}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Do you remember \\
  how we used to play \\
  winter in spring?

  You would furrow my hair \\
  with the tip of your tongue \\
  and the fields would shiver \\
  under the plough

  I would sit behind you \\
  and embrace you like a coat \\
  my breath sending a frisson \\
  down your spine

  I would pretend to sled \\
  my hands on your waist \\
  and your nervous laughter \\
  would melt my heart

  As exhausted as the day \\
  you would fall back on me \\
  and our breaths like geysers \\
  meet the night immense \\
  and become one silence
\end{verse}

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{the infinite kaleidoscope}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Once \\
  through a window \\
  of the log cabin \\
  at dawn

  we caught \\
  the shivering world \\
  transfixed \\
  watching its reflection \\
  in the dew

  In a blink \\
  the round mirrors \\
  of iridescent water \\
  had formed \\
  a boundless kaleidoscope \\
  and showed each other

  your dreamy eyes \\
  and vision wide

  and wondered
\end{verse}

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{Yet you arise in the still second}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Already the avid hour \\
  swallows \\
  the shores of the world

  Towards the horizon \\
  shadows pursue whispers \\
  lost amongst the graves \\
  along the walls

  From his skull \\
  the poet sees everywhere \\
  ink flooding him

  Yet you arise \\
  in the still second \\
  illuminating the doorway \\
  of my vault

  your bright face \\
  smiling down on me \\
  simple and elegant \\
  like a blade

  In a sarabande \\
  you seem to say \\
  come outside \\
  in the fields of blue

  and let your heart \\
  slowly beat the drum \\
  of another day

  let this long night \\
  surprise you \\
  with a blue moon
\end{verse}

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{my lips still reach for the heavens}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  The dying day shrinks \\
  between the clouds \\
  and the rain starts drawing \\
  mirrors in the mud

  until darkness drowns \\
  the match of eloquence \\
  and needles start piercing \\
  the firmament \\
  in suns uncountable

  They blink leagues away \\
  like you used to

  when you stretched over me \\
  like a constellation \\
  and kissed me distantly

  Now on my knees \\
  my lips still reach for the stars \\
  but the gulp is dirty water
\end{verse}
