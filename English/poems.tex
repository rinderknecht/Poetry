\settowidth{\versewidth}{Like a make-believe ghost}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Like a cup of tea \\
  overflowing

  she keeps going places \\
  unexpected \\
  beyond will and power

  drawing silhouettes \\
  of sweet fragrance \\
  on the white morning

  and I can't help but clutch \\
  at the burning tablecloth

  again and again

  I drape this tainted love \\
  over my broken heart \\
  and I keep going places \\
  unexpected

  like a make-believe ghost \\
  haunting every cup of tea \\
  with a trembling face
\end{verse}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{You hand me a second jar}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Without a thought \\
  you hand me a second jar

  Without a thought \\
  I open it and you smile \\
  in profile \\
  at this intimacy \\
  like a wife

  Hidden in plain sight \\
  I wish we were them

  secret delights \\
  that can touch \\
  and be open \\
  without a thought
\end{verse}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{float on a world of silence}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Late among the guests \\
  shining and laughing \\
  at brilliant jokes

  we share one last drink \\
  with two ice cubes

  Side by side \\
  complicit and beautiful

  reflecting the moonlight

  fatal icebergs \\
  always \\
  float in a world of silence

  always \\
  shortchange the stars \\
  ninety percent

  below the surface
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{gently beat to the rhythm}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Her dangling arms \\
  abandoned to the wind \\
  like lianas

  gently beat to the rhythm \\
  of her footsteps

  oblivious to the choir \\
  of the forest around us \\
  whispering

  staring \\
  at the divine pendulums

  waiting for a sign

  as I do

  know the wild deer \\
  invisible yet so close

  Hear its deep chest \\
  darkly drumming \\
  an untamed song

  about you
\end{verse}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{--- Let's make French toasts!}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  What a waste \\
  I tell myself

  this whole bread \\
  stale \\
  which you forgot \\
  at the back of the cupboard

  I remember the loaf \\
  warm and tender \\
  like a promise \\
  of young love

  and

  --- Let's make French toasts! \\
  you say
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{When you go through my lines}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  When you go through my lines \\
  with me

  sometimes \\
  I slip in my own words \\
  and you want to slip too

  with me

  a blank page
\end{verse}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{to the clear waters}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Away

  birch trees \\
  bathed \\
  in warm sunlight

  Close

  your white fingers \\
  combing \\
  your golden hair

  Blinded

  you guide my hands \\
  to the clear waters \\
  of the fountain

  Thirsty

  from your lips \\
  the gulp \\
  eclipses the sun
\end{verse}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{to the halo of your blond hair}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  You used to hide in my books \\
  like in crannies and nooks

  I would find you in Neruda \\
  sieving my favourite pages \\
  for a nugget of my soul

  But metaphors whispered \\
  in ways I could not \\
  in ways I dared not

  until I found a curl of hair \\
  you left in a margin

  Suddenly

  a prod to the brass spring \\
  sends my heart palpitating \\
  like a broken watch

  Bent over those pages \\
  on the corner of a table \\
  the words fade to white \\
  like a film overexposed \\
  to the halo of your blond hair

  only leaving behind \\
  the offbeat heart \\
  of a blind man
\end{verse}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{on your body of soft amber}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Tonight \\
  you open for me \\
  an alchemy book

  By the oil lamp \\
  flickering \\
  the mute book speaks \\
  in crucibles and symbols

  of wild roses blooming \\
  on a lover's grave

  of a split pomegranate \\
  under two half moons

  of bellows sighing \\
  over furnace anew

  of the mystical kiss \\
  of water and fire

  of the geography \\
  of beauty spots

  a secret zodiac for all senses \\
  on your body of soft amber \\
  where I die and am reborn
\end{verse}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{and our breaths like geysers}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Do you remember \\
  how we used to play \\
  winter in summer?

  You would furrow my hair \\
  with the tip of your tongue \\
  and the field would shiver \\
  under the plough

  I would sit behind you \\
  and embrace you like a coat \\
  my breath sending a frisson \\
  down your spine

  I would pretend to sled \\
  my hands on your waist \\
  and your nervous laughter \\
  would melt my heart

  As exhausted as the day \\
  you fall back on me \\
  and our breaths like geysers \\
  ascend to the starry night

  slowly spinning \\
  around our cold noses \\
  against each other \\
  in the equator of my arms \\
  around you
\end{verse}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{the infinite kaleidoscope}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Once \\
  through a window \\
  of the log cabin \\
  at dawn

  we caught \\
  the shivering world \\
  transfixed \\
  watching its reflection \\
  in the dew

  In a blink \\
  the round mirrors \\
  of iridescent water \\
  had formed \\
  a boundless kaleidoscope \\
  and showed each other

  your dreamy eyes \\
  in vision wide

  and wondered
\end{verse}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{Yet you arise in the still second}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Already the avid hour \\
  swallows \\
  the shores of the world

  Towards the horizon \\
  shadows pursue whispers \\
  lost amongst the graves \\
  along the walls

  From his skull \\
  the poet sees everywhere \\
  ink flooding in

  Yet you arise \\
  in the still second \\
  illuminating the doorway \\
  of the vault

  your bright face \\
  smiling down on me \\
  simple and elegant \\
  like a blade

  In a sarabande \\
  you seem to say \\
  come outside \\
  in the fields of blue

  and let your heart \\
  slowly beat the drum \\
  of another day

  let this long night \\
  surprise you \\
  with a blue moon
\end{verse}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{my lips still reach for the heavens}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  The dying day shrinks \\
  between the clouds \\
  and the rain starts drawing \\
  mirrors in the mud

  until darkness drowns \\
  the match of eloquence \\
  and needles start piercing \\
  the firmament \\
  in suns uncountable

  They blink leagues away \\
  like you used to

  when you stretched over me \\
  like a constellation \\
  and kissed me distantly

  Now on my knees \\
  my lips still reach for the stars \\
  but the gulp is dirty water
\end{verse}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{like those of a silent film actor}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Quietly set against the light \\
  you are perfectly framed

  I don't care what they think \\
  about the optics of love \\
  about the perfect shot \\
  at wild happiness

  Like a forest \\
  leaning against the twilight

  you harbour within yourself \\
  a multitude of lives \\
  that murmur darkly like one \\
  and suddenly go quiet \\
  whenever someone laughs

  Slowly I dare a hand \\
  to your black hair \\
  shadow amongst shadows

  But you are startled by my eyes \\
  like those of a silent film actor \\
  in a close-up

  Caught in my headlights \\
  this magnificent soul of yours \\
  hesitates before fliting away

  leaving me in awe

  pupils dilated \\
  quietly peering into your night
\end{verse}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{yet better off than broken up}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\emph{In my brimming eyes}

the hinterland \\
suddenly \\
met a rising tide

\emph{a painting by Turner}

of ripped curtains of mist \\
behind an old boat \\
tugged to her last berth \\
to be broken up

\emph{where flowing waters wash}

beams and lashes across

\emph{your overcast eyelines}

wrecked by promises \\
lying eerily at the bottom \\
of your Black Sea

\emph{magnificent and haunting}

you follow again the wind \\
moaning in faraway sails
\end{verse}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{and who would love us then}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  In your secret garden \\
  when the early light \\
  accounts for the world \\
  you prune the rosebushes

  like the many queer lives \\
  within you that ask \\
  something always refused

  You keep saying to them

  \emph{If I listened to you \\
  we would grow wild \\
  and who would love us then \\
  You can only feel and I see \\
  Go to your places and sleep}

  But sometimes \\
  a whisper quivers \\
  and blooms under the sun

  transfiguring you \\
  and making you divine \\
  inspite of yourself

  before fliting away \\
  like a dream cut short

  Will you ever be \\
  like that always \\
  for any one being?
\end{verse}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{and more ocean between us}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Catching in my sails \\
  oblique sunbeams \\
  from the fleeing horizon

  I hold precious cargo \\
  on the seas \\
  above the firmament

  \emph{I set the course}

  for your heart overturned \\
  like an inkwell on a letter

  \emph{to you}

  for I smuggle jewels \\
  from the celestial orbs

  \emph{under the cover of night}

  I will show you \\
  how quaint and eccentric \\
  my treasure is

  \emph{like a comet}

  I always feel the pull \\
  to your circular orbit

  \emph{from an archipelago \\
  of solitude}
\end{verse}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{Under shroud and vermin}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Under a coat of ermine \\
  dreams offer the skies \\
  echos scattered away

  on the white page

  the inkwell overturns \\
  like the horizon

  Under shroud and vermin \\
  the yearning soul cries \\
  echos scattered away

  on the snow field

  darkness many returns \\
  flood the horizon
\end{verse}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{Northern breeze whispers}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Hope is the aster \\
in the eastern plain \\
of weeds and flower \\
from last night's rain

Blue is the flower \\
under sky unborn \\
like secret Easter \\
too bright to be borne

Northern breeze whispers \\
to the shapphire \\
worships of vespers \\
and hearths with fire

but wind's promises \\
blow the candlelight \\
and its soft kisses \\
will bid you goodnight

Oh picking you up \\
to my bleeding heart! \\
Oh drink from my cup \\
in my life take part!

No more rolling dice \\
your petals like lips \\
will touch Paradise \\
where love never sleeps
\end{verse}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{to the necklaces of their laughter}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Sleds rush down a hill~--- \\
  each bump threading a note \\
  to the braids of their life lines \\
  to the necklaces of their laughter

  Like them \\
  I draw on immaculate pages \\
  invisible parallels \\
  that conjure up your silhouette

  Hide and seek in the mist~--- \\
  your white hands over my eyes \\
  your panting for breath \\
  sends a long shiver down \\
  blending with that of winter

  I caress the blank pages \\
  of a book open to the invisible \\
  invoking your pale body \\
  under my fingers

  trembling on soft hills

  my breath is taken away \\
  at each descent \\
  so impatient \\
  at each ascent

  Exhausted~--- \\
  lying on the snow \\
  we watch passing clouds \\
  and I quench my thirst \\
  in the calm stream \\
  of your words \\
  before oblivion

  Only remain these verses \\
  in Braille \\
  where I feel your steps \\
  towards the white paradise
\end{verse}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\newpage

\poemtitle{}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{like that afternoon}

\bigskip

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  In this waltz \\
  of oblivion and regrets

  I step forwards \\
  and I forget \\
  all the lessons \\
  I swore to remember

  You step backwards \\
  and you regret \\
  learning so much \\
  about me

  Come

  The third beat \\
  is not here yet \\
  We don't have to repeat \\
  the same mistakes

  against each other

  let us stand still \\
  like that afternoon \\
  in the pouring rain \\
  when I warmed you \\
  in my arms
\end{verse}
