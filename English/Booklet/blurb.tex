The poems contained in this booklet are meant to be punchy, as well as reflective. They have been considered to be beautiful and powerful, stemming in darkness and slanting towards the moonlight. As far as the form is concerned, they make almost no use of punctuation, with two practical consequences. First, the layout of the text on the page is very important, suggesting missing punctuation and rests, but also enabling double meanings, depending on how the punctuation is imagined by the reader. Second, most poems being run-on sentences, they should give rise to a feeling of breathlessness, even when not reading aloud. By design, these poems require an active involvement of the reader, and more than one reading is expected in order to become intimate with them. Certain words have been chosen for their multiple meanings as well, therefore this booklet is larger than one might think.
