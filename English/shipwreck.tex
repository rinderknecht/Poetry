\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The hinterland \\
suddenly \\
met a rising tide

in my brimming eyes

a painting by Turner \\
of ripped curtains of mist \\
behind an old boat \\
tugged to her last berth

to be broken up

The bitter waters \\
also brought a raft \\
aground

in your overcast eyes

wrecked like promises \\
lying quietly at the bottom \\
of some Black Sea \\
---~pristine and haunting

yet better off than broken up

you heard the wind \\
moaning in search \\
of faraway sails
\end{verse}
