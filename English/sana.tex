\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I had left the silence before you, \\
born of a violent collision long ago.

Asteroids had been circling \\
around you at the night party, \\
admiring you like a clock tower, \\
wasting your time.

Suddenly I saw your bright face \\
fill up when our hands aligned, \\
and high noon struck behind midnight.

Eccentric like a comet, \\
I drew closer and closer \\
until a new moon, \\
and we started dancing \\
in the chaotic embrace \\
of a three-body problem:

No matter how close we are now, \\
there is no telling \\
how far we'll be tomorrow;

no matter how far apart we are now, \\
we might collide tomorrow, \\
for violent attractions \\
meet violent delights

sometimes.
\end{verse}
