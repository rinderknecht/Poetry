\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Like a cup of tea \\
  overflowing

  she keeps going places \\
  unexpected \\
  beyond will and power

  drawing silhouettes \\
  of sweet fragrance \\
  on this white morning

  and I can't help but clutch \\
  at the burning tablecloth

  again and again

  I drape this tainted love \\
  over my broken heart \\
  and I keep going places \\
  unexpected

  like a make-believe ghost \\
  haunting cups of tea \\
  with trembling faces.

  Late among the guests \\

  Side by side \\

\poemtitle{Death of Attila József}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{that can only journey down}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  A lonely sleeper at night \\
  waits on railway tracks \\
  to be taken away

  like a casket steadied \\
  on iron shoulders \\
  that can only journey down

  Among his own shadow \\
  and the dreamy clanging \\
  of freight trains switching

  the poet bids farewell \\
  to the cogwheels of trains \\
  and desires switching.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Hope is the aster \\
  in the eastern plain \\
  of weeds and flower \\
  from last night's rain

  Blue is the flower \\
  under sky unborn \\
  like secret Easter \\
  too bright to be borne

  Northern breeze whispers \\
  to the sapphire \\
  worships of vespers \\
  and hearths with fire

  but wind's promises \\
  blow the candlelight \\
  and its soft kisses \\
  will bid you goodnight

  Oh picking you up \\
  to my bleeding heart! \\
  Oh drink from my cup \\
  in my life take part!

  No more rolling dice: \\
  your petals like lips \\
  will touch Paradise \\
  where love never sleeps
\end{verse}
