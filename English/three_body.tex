\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  You had left the silence \\
  born of a violent collision \\
  long ago

  In seconds \\
  they were circling you \\
  at the night party \\
  admiring you like a clock tower

  wasting your time

  But suddenly \\
  I saw your bright face fill up \\
  when your hands aligned with his \\
  and high noon struck at midnight

  Eccentric like a comet \\
  I drew closer and closer \\
  and we started dancing \\
  in the chaotic embrace \\
  of a three-body problem

  No matter how close we are now \\
  there is no telling \\
  how far we'll be tomorrow

  No matter how far apart \\
  we'll be tomorrow \\
  we might collide now

  for violent attractions \\
  meet violent delights

  sometimes.
\end{verse}
