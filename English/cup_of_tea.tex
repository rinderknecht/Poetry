\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Sadness does not depart with her

Like a cup of tea\\
overflowing\\
she keeps going places\\
unexpected\\
beyond will and power

dyeing the tablecloth\\
with a silhouette\\
of sweet fragrance\\
in the white morning

I can't help but clutch\\
at the tainted sail\\
forlorn and useless\\
on my shore

In the still second\\
I hold my breath\\
and wish for the ebb\\
to take me away\\
to take her away

What is left but drape my heart\\
with her warm remembrance\\
like a make-believe ghost?

Come Sadness!

Let us play a game:\\
stop this deluge\\
and find my trembling face\\
in every cup of tea
\end{verse}
