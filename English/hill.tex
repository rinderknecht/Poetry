\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  Running up that hill, \\
  it hurts like in that song we like.

  When I said: \\
  ``I'll follow where you belong'', \\
  I didn't know what it's like, \\
  running up that hill, you know?

  When you said: \\
  ``You'll never understand me'', \\
  I got scared to slip my fingers \\
  inside the cage.

  A pretty stone in hand, \\
  I keep running up that mountain \\
  where you search for a refrain \\
  asleep in your guitar.

  But you don't know I found it \\
  in Sisyphus' dream, \\
  and it hurts like in that song  we like.
\end{verse}
