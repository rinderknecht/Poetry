Attila József is one of the most famous poets of Hungary. His
relatively short life in the first half of the 20th century was one of
hardships and disappointments, but also profound visions of beauty,
and intense feelings of love and hope. Some contemporary Hungarians,
while acknowledging his genius, regret that his poetry resonates too
much with the moodiness of the Hungarian soul. While there are indeed
pits of despair in József poems, those are taught in schools because
they are beautiful, surprising and authentic, and that enables an
appreciation, a connection with them later in our lives, when we
become intimate with despair. Besides, we can also find contemplation,
friendship, politics, humour, content, hope: this is what I aimed to
achieve in this short bilingual anthology.
